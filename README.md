#  my-first-react-todo-app
Simple react todo app with hooks! ⚓

## Decisions:

- [x] I havent's used any UI framework or React framework. But I have added some CSS code of my own and a couple of libraries...:
    - `dayjs` to format dates easily (2KB library)
    - `typography` to deal with vertical rythm and default text styles.
    - `prop-types` (React Prop Types) to type inherited props
    - `@graficos/graficols` my very first npm module for creating cols ☺.
    - `popmotion` and `stylefire` for animations.

- [x] I am using Parcel instead of Webpack. Not as powerfull but 100 times easier to set up.

- [x] I have added my own Eslint rules.

## TODO in my TODO app:

- [ ] better responsive and UX
- [ ] filtering buttons (show only some ToDos...)
